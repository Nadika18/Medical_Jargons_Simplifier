This helped improve the patient\'s symptoms, allowing them to swallow solid foods again without vomiting. The next step is to do a procedure called an endoscopy (where a tube with a camera on the end is inserted into their mouth and down their throat) to see how bad the hernia is and take a biopsy (a sample of tissue) to learn more about what\'s going on.
